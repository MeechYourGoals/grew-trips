## Prerequisites

### What You'll Need:
- ✅ Mac with Xcode installed (you have this!)
- ✅ This project (you have this!)
- ⏳ Apple Developer Account ($99/year - we'll set this up)
- ⏳ App icons (1024x1024px - we'll help you create these)
- ⏳ iPhone for testing (optional but recommended)

### Backend Services Verification

Before building for iOS, ensure these backend services are configured:

**Required Supabase Edge Functions:**
- ✅ `create-checkout` - Stripe payment initialization
- ✅ `check-subscription` - Verify user subscription status
- ✅ `customer-portal` - Stripe subscription management
- ✅ `send-organization-invite` - Email invitations for teams

**Required Secrets in Supabase:**
```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxxxx    # Stripe API key (use test key for testing)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxx            # Resend email API key  
APP_URL=https://chravel.app        # Production app URL for invite links
```

**Required Database Tables:**
All tables should have RLS (Row Level Security) enabled:
- `loyalty_airlines`, `loyalty_hotels`, `loyalty_rentals` (Travel Wallet)
- `game_schedules`, `show_schedules` (Enterprise scheduling)
- `saved_recommendations`, `trip_links` (Saved places)
- `trips.is_archived` column (Archive functionality)

**Verify Backend Services:**
```bash
# Test edge functions
curl -X POST https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co/functions/v1/check-subscription \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY"

# Check RLS policies are enabled
# Go to Supabase Dashboard → Database → Tables → Check RLS column
```

## 1. Apple Developer Account Setup

### Step 1.1: Enroll in the Apple Developer Program

1. **Go to Apple Developer**: Visit https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/
2. **Sign in**: Use your Apple ID (the one you use for iCloud, App Store, etc.)
3. **Click "Enroll"**: Follow the prompts
4. **Pay $99**: This is an annual fee. You can pay with credit card or Apple Pay
5. **Wait for approval**: Usually takes 24-48 hours

**Note**: You MUST have this before you can publish to the App Store. You can still test on your own device during the waiting period.

### Step 1.2: Accept Legal Agreements

1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/account/
2. Click on "Agreements, Tax, and Banking"
3. Accept all agreements

---

## 2. Preparing for Production Build

### Step 2.1: Switch to Production Mode

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** The development version uses a live hot-reload server. For App Store submission, you must build static assets.

1. **Edit `capacitor.config.ts`:**
   ```typescript
   // REMOVE or COMMENT OUT the server block:
   // server: {
   //   url: 'https://20feaa04-0946-4c68-a68d-0eb88cc1b9c4.lovableproject.com?forceHideBadge=true',
   //   cleartext: true
   // },
   ```

2. **Build production assets:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Sync to iOS:**
   ```bash
   npx cap sync ios
   ```

4. **Verify static build:**
   - Open Xcode: `npx cap open ios`
   - Run on simulator - should work WITHOUT internet connection to lovableproject.com
   - If app shows blank screen, check Console for errors (View → Debug Area → Show Debug Area)

**⚠️ NEVER submit to App Store with the hot-reload server URL.** Apple will reject apps that rely on external dev servers.

## 3. Opening Your Project in Xcode

### Step 3.1: Open Terminal

1. Press `Command + Space` to open Spotlight
2. Type "Terminal" and press Enter

### Step 3.2: Navigate to Your Project

In Terminal, type these commands one at a time:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Open in Xcode (this will open the iOS project)
npx cap open ios
```

**Alternative**: You can also manually navigate to your project folder in Finder, go to the `ios/App` folder, and double-click `App.xcworkspace` (NOT App.xcodeproj!)

---

## 4. Configuring Your App in Xcode

Once Xcode opens, you'll see your project. Here's what to configure:

### Step 3.1: Select Your Project

1. In the left sidebar, click on the **blue "App" icon** at the very top
2. Make sure the **"TARGETS" → "App"** is selected (not "PROJECT")

### Step 3.2: Configure General Settings

In the main panel, you'll see several tabs. Make sure you're on **"General"**:

#### Identity Section:
- **Display Name**: `Chravel` (This is what users see on their home screen)
- **Bundle Identifier**: Should already be `com.chravel.app`
- **Version**: `1.0.0` (your first version)
- **Build**: `1` (increment this for each upload)

#### Deployment Info:
- **iPhone Orientation**: Choose which orientations to support
  - Portrait (recommended for most apps)
  - Landscape Left/Right (optional)
- **Minimum Deployment**: iOS 13.0 or higher is good

### Step 3.3: Signing & Capabilities

This is CRITICAL and often where beginners get stuck!

1. Click the **"Signing & Capabilities"** tab
2. Under **"Debug"** section:
   - ☑️ Check "Automatically manage signing"
   - **Team**: Select your Apple Developer account from dropdown
     - If you don't see your team, go to Xcode → Settings → Accounts and add your Apple ID
   - Xcode will automatically create a provisioning profile

3. Under **"Release"** section:
   - ☑️ Check "Automatically manage signing"
   - **Team**: Same as Debug
   - If you see any errors here, they'll usually auto-resolve. If not, click the error for details.

### Step 4.4: Add Required Capabilities

Your app uses these capabilities:

1. Click **"+ Capability"** button
2. Add these one by one:
   
   **Push Notifications** ✅
   - For chat messages, trip updates, payment alerts

   **Background Modes** ✅
   - ☑️ Remote notifications
   - ☑️ Background fetch (for real-time sync)

   **Associated Domains** (NEW)
   - Click "+ Capability" → Search "Associated Domains"
   - Add domain: `applinks:chravel.app`
   - Purpose: Deep linking for invitation emails, payment confirmations

   **App Groups** (Optional - for future extensions)
   - Click "+ Capability" → Search "App Groups"  
   - Add: `group.com.chravel.app`
   - Purpose: Share data between app and widgets/extensions

---

## 5. Adding App Icons

Your app needs icons in various sizes. The easiest way:

### Step 4.1: Create Your Icon

You need a **1024x1024 pixel PNG image** with:
- No transparency
- No rounded corners (iOS adds these automatically)
- High quality and recognizable at small sizes

**Option A - Use a Design Tool**:
- Canva: https://www.canva.com/ (free, easy)
- Figma: https://www.figma.com/ (free)
- Adobe Express: https://www.adobe.com/express/

**Option B - Hire a Designer**:
- Fiverr: ~$5-50 for app icons
- 99designs: More expensive but higher quality

### Step 4.2: Generate All Required Sizes

Use this free online tool:
1. Go to https://www.appicon.co/
2. Upload your 1024x1024 PNG
3. Select "iOS"
4. Click "Generate"
5. Download the zip file

### Step 4.3: Add Icons to Xcode

1. In Xcode's left sidebar, click the folder icon
2. Navigate to `App → App → Assets.xcassets`
3. Click on **"AppIcon"**
4. You'll see empty boxes for different icon sizes
5. Drag and drop each icon from your downloaded folder into the corresponding box
   - The file names should match (e.g., `icon-20@2x.png` → the box labeled "20pt @2x")

**Important**: You MUST fill in the 1024x1024 "App Store" icon box - this is required for submission!

---

## 6. Testing on a Real Device (Optional but Recommended)

Before submitting to the App Store, test on a real iPhone:

### Step 5.1: Connect Your iPhone

1. Plug your iPhone into your Mac with a cable
2. Unlock your iPhone
3. If prompted "Trust This Computer?", tap **"Trust"**

### Step 5.2: Select Your Device

1. In Xcode's top toolbar, find the device dropdown (left of the Run button)
2. Click it and select your iPhone (it should show your device name)

### Step 5.3: Run the App

1. Click the **▶️ Play button** (or press `Command + R`)
2. Xcode will build and install the app on your device
3. **First time only**: On your iPhone, go to Settings → General → VPN & Device Management → Developer App → Trust

The app should now launch on your iPhone! Test all features.

## 🆘 Common Issues and Solutions

### "No accounts with App Store Connect access"
**Solution**: Make sure your Apple Developer enrollment is complete and accepted

### "Failed to create provisioning profile"
**Solution**:
1. Go to Xcode → Settings → Accounts
2. Select your Apple ID → Download Manual Profiles
3. Try again

### "The bundle identifier is already in use"
**Solution**: Change your bundle identifier in Xcode to something unique like `com.yourname.chravel`

### "Missing compliance" during upload
**Solution**: You'll be asked about encryption - for most apps, select "No" unless you use custom encryption

### App crashes immediately on device
**Solution**:
1. Check Console logs in Xcode (View → Debug Area → Show Debug Area)
2. Verify `capacitor.config.ts` has NO server URL (production build only)
3. Run `npm run build` and `npx cap sync ios` again
4. Check for missing Capacitor plugins

### "App shows blank white screen on device"
**Solution:** 
1. Verify you removed `server` block from `capacitor.config.ts`
2. Verify you ran `npm run build` before `npx cap sync ios`
3. Check Xcode Console for errors (View → Debug Area → Activate Console)
4. Look for CORS or network errors in logs
5. Ensure all required assets are in `dist` folder

### "Features not working on device but work in simulator"
**Solution:**
1. Push notifications require real device (simulator doesn't support)
2. Camera requires real device camera access
3. Check that all required capabilities are added in Xcode
4. Verify RLS policies allow the test account access in Supabase

### "Stripe checkout not opening"
**Solution:**
1. Verify `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is set in Supabase secrets
2. Test `create-checkout` edge function directly with curl
3. Check Stripe Dashboard for product/price IDs matching code
4. Ensure app has network permissions
5. Check Console logs for specific error messages

### "Organization invites not sending"
**Solution:**
1. Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in Supabase secrets
2. Verify `APP_URL` is set to production domain
3. Test `send-organization-invite` edge function directly
4. Check Resend dashboard for email send logs and errors
5. Ensure FROM email is verified in Resend

### "Archive feature not persisting"
**Solution:**
1. Old version used localStorage - new version uses Supabase
2. Verify `trips.is_archived` column exists in database
3. Check RLS policies allow user to UPDATE trips table
4. Clear app data and reinstall if migrating from old version
5. Test with fresh demo account

### "Game/Show schedule not loading"
**Solution:**
1. Verify `game_schedules` and `show_schedules` tables exist
2. Check RLS policies allow organization members to SELECT
3. Verify user is a member of the organization in database
4. Check Supabase logs for query errors
5. Test with pro-demo@chravel.com account

### "Could not find a suitable device"
**Solution**: Make sure you're building for "Any iOS Device" not a simulator before archiving
