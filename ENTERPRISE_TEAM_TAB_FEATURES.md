Integrate `ChannelSwitcher` into `TripChat.tsx`:
```typescript
import { ChannelSwitcher } from './chat/ChannelSwitcher';
import { useRoleChannels } from '../hooks/useRoleChannels';

// In TripChat component:
const { availableChannels, activeChannel, setActiveChannel } = useRoleChannels(tripId, userRole);

// Add to chat header:
{availableChannels.length > 0 && (
  <ChannelSwitcher
    activeChannel={activeChannel?.id || 'main'}
    roleChannels={availableChannels}
    onChannelChange={(channelId) => {
      if (channelId === 'main') {
        setActiveChannel(null);
      } else {
        setActiveChannel(availableChannels.find(ch => ch.id === channelId) || null);
      }
    }}
