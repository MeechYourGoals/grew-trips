## 🔧 **Environment Configuration**

The Supabase functions that power the AI features need access to these environment variables:

- `LOVABLE_API_KEY` – required for AI Concierge powered by Google Gemini
- `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` – allow the functions to read and write data
- `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` – required for Google Maps integration and grounding
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` – frontend Supabase connection

Set these variables when running `supabase functions serve` locally.
When deploying, set the same variables using `supabase secrets set`.
